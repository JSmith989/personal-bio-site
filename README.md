# My Personal Website
<p>This project is a work in progress. Like that one road about a mile away where construction never seems to stop. But when it's finished and you drive on that new pavement for the first time... you wish all roads could be like that all the time. That's what I'm going for in my personal bio project. So far I've used javascript, css, html, and bootstrap. </p>
