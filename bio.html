      <p class="my-background">In my younger years, I used to start a million different projects and finish only about half of them. I still start a million projects, but now I enjoy finishing all of them. My work background is pretty eclectic. Most of it has been spent in the specialty coffee industry where I was a manager, trainer, and jack of all trades. I currently work on draft beer systems. I have a huge love of music, gardening, cooking, being a husband and father.  </p>
      <p class="my-development">My quest into the world of development started in 2019. A good friend of mine introduced me into this field and I knew it was something I would really enjoy doing. The process is very similar to how I write music and well, pretty much any project I start. At first I tried to learn all about development online but I didn't even know where to start. I was shoveling in all of this new information with no real goal in mind other than to learn everything I could about programming. Quickly, I realized I needed to talk to more people about how to get started. A few friends had been through the program at NSS and recommended it. In this chaotic year that is 2020, my decision was to dive head first into NSS and try to take advantage of this pandemic.  </p>
